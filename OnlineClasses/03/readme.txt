The line public static void main(String[] args) is the starting point of any Java program. Here's a breakdown of each part: 
public:
This access modifier means the method is accessible from anywhere, even outside of the class where it's defined. 
static:
This allows the method to be called without creating an object of the class. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can directly invoke it. 
void:
This indicates that the method doesn't return any value. It's simply executed and doesn't send any data back to the caller. 
main:
This is a special name recognized by the JVM. It's the entry point for execution. 
String[] args:
This is an array of strings that holds command-line arguments that can be passed to the program when it's executed. 
In essence, this method signature tells the JVM where to begin running the program, and it can optionally accept command-line arguments.
