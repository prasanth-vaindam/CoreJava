    // what are characters in Java?
       // Characters in Java are represented by the char data type, which is used to store single 16-bit Unicode characters.
       // A character can be a letter, digit, symbol, or whitespace.
       // For example, 'A', '1', '$', and ' ' (space) are all valid characters in Java.
       // Characters are enclosed in single quotes, like 'A'.
       // You can also use escape sequences to represent special characters, such as '\n' for a newline or '\t' for a tab.
