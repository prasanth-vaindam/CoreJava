        // They can also be used to temporarily disable code without deleting it.
        
        // For example, the following line is commented out and won't execute:
        // System.out.println("This line is commented out and won't run.");

        // You can use comments to leave notes for yourself or others who read your code.
        // It's a good practice to write clear and concise comments.
